Dear Admission Committee,

I'm writing to the Universita Politecnica Delle Marche to apply for the master's program in international economics and commerce. I recently earned my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Ethiopia, and I can't wait to study international economics and commerce in more detail. I am confident that this scholarship opportunity will give me the information and abilities I need to confront the issues of global development that my home country's small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) face and support their expansion and prosperity.

My computer engineering undergraduate degree gave me a solid technical basis and helped me hone my problem-solving abilities. But as I went along, I developed a growing curiosity about the nexus between business and technology and saw how technology could be used to spur innovation and economic success. I saw during my studies the difficulties that developing nations like Ethiopia have while trying to join the global value chain. Many local businesses fail to expand globally because they predominantly engage in low-value-added operations. I realized that enabling these SMEs to thrive abroad is essential to the resilience and expansion of the Ethiopian economy, especially in light of adversities like the COVID-19 pandemic.97% of the workforce in the country works for SMEs, thus it is critical to give them the tools they need to compete in the global economy. My technical expertise and enthusiasm for global trade and business put me in a good position to bridge the gap between business strategy and technology to help the expansion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Ethiopia.

My goal is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of international trade policies, global marketplaces, and strategic corporate growth by obtaining a Master's degree in international economics and commerce. I will graduate from this program with the knowledge and skills necessary to handle the unique difficulties faced by SMEs in Ethiopia and support their growth and success.I want to use the knowledge and abilities I've acquired to have a significant impact on the Ethiopian market after I graduate from college. To support the development and competitiveness of regional SMEs, I intend to spearhead projects that integrate technology innovation with calculated corporate expansion. I will provide Ethiopian business owners with the skills they need to take advantage of technology, enter international markets, and propel economic growth through community-based training initiatives.

The Universita Politecnica Delle Marche is a standout choice for my studies because of its esteemed academic program, emphasis on global economics, and knowledgeable instructors. I have a thorough awareness of the global business scene because of the program's extensive curriculum, which covers important topics like trade policies, marketing, and emerging markets. I am very thrilled about the chance to receive instruction from renowned professors who are experts in their domains.I am dedicated to mastering the foundational Italian language and becoming familiar with Italian society's principles to fully immerse myself in the local culture and make the most of my educational experience. I think that assimilating into the local way of life will help me learn more about the dynamics of international economics and create close relationships with other members of the academic community.

I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to review my application for a master's program at the Universita Politecnica Delle Marche. I'm sure that this scholarship will afford me the tools and chances I need to blend my technical expertise with business savvy, allowing me to tackle the issues SMEs in Ethiopia are facing with global development. I appreciate your time and consideration, and I'm excited about the prospect of learning at your prestigious organization.

Sincerely,
